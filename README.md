SFL are a leading production supplier and AV installations partner both in the UK and internationally.

We create environments to help people to communicate. We do that by using audio, visual, lighting, scenic and print elements of production technology. We deliver across all industries, throughout Europe. We deliver to scale from smaller boutique events to ones with many thousands in attendance.

SFL’s business ethos places huge value on relationship, with a strong focus on delivering long term added value to all of our customers. With our proven history you can have complete confidence in the level of continued support going into the future.

We believe that: “Technology is necessary but not sufficient”

Whatever size of event or installation you are planning, you need to know that you have the very best support behind you.
